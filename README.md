# rw-fix-region-acronyms
A Rain World tool to change region acronyms to other ones.  
You'll be asked to provide path to folder, old acronym and new one(all acronyms have to be in upper case).  
`output` folder, containing initial folder with changed acronyms will be generated locally. Be careful, as `output` folder is cleared before copying region into it.
